# arangodb-cli-helper
Some random collection of scripts to make the daily work with the arangodb codebase more enjoyable.

Add the `bin/` directory to your PATH, and export the following environment
variables, which are hopefully self-explanatory:

```
ADB_JENKINS_USER
ADB_JENKINS_TOKEN
ADB_GITHUB_USER
ADB_GITHUB_TOKEN
ADB_SLACK_USER
```

To get bash completion, call

```
source path-to-here/bash-completion.bash
```

in your `~/.bashrc`.
